From what I understand about Jane Austen, before her there were no other authors who narrated the human psyche as much as she did within the writings of a novel.  Her descriptions of society and of the inner the minds of her heroes and heroines changed the face of the English Literature.  Despite all of the rants and ravings I’ve heard over the years, mainly from women, about the excellence of Jane Austen… well, frankly I was uninterested. </p1><p>

In developing my passion for “The Classics,” I knew that Jane Austen could not be avoided forever.  Perhaps it was when my daughter started reading it that I thought to myself, “Okay, it’s time Sheri.”  And, so it was.  The good news is that reading this classic with an adult and appreciative mind, I was able to see the beauty in this literary masterpiece in a way that I’m not sure my high-school or college eyes would see.  As such, I read this book with a fervor that I can’t quite exactly explain.  I read this book quickly and aggressively because I was hooked.  Now, it’s not like a page-turner where you can’t wait to find out what happens next in the storyline.  In fact, expect the opposite in reading Austen.  There’s not much to the storyline at all.  I could sum up the events of this story in a paragraph lined with a few sentences… no problem!  Rather, it’s the addiction to discover the inner workings of the minds of the characters.  As a reader, I couldn’t wait to see Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy find a way to one another… What would Mr. Darcy do to convince her that he was the type of man that she could and would love?  Would the heart of this strong-willed woman melt in the arms of this uber-wealthy, super handsome man?  Would HE finally be deserving of her love?
</p><p>
In speaking to others about this book, there is one main discovery that I’ve made.  The readers of this book have made these characters their own within their minds.  Whether they are loved, disliked or even what they look like is a very personal thing to the lovers of this book.  I must admit that I am NO different.  In watching the movie starring Keira Knightly, I formed strong opinions about the casting of the characters and how the movie was filmed.  It had to match my imagination for it to be right and good.  Now, this is something new and different for me.  Most book to movie translations I pick apart for other reasons… most commonly that the movie didn’t match the story within the book.  Because Pride & Prejudice is such a character-driven, psychological tale, it is that the characters must be cast like the book.  Here’s where the problem lies, the characters are formed in each reader’s personal imagination and no two Mr. Darcy’s are alike.
</p><p>
I never, IN A MILLION YEARS, thought that I would ever be the type of person who now wants to see every movie version of Pride & Prejudice.  But, I do!  Nor did I ever imagine myself wanting to discuss a book as much as I want to discuss this one… but, only with women!  I’m just not that type of gal.  But, I guess apparently I am.  I’m shocked at myself.</p>
