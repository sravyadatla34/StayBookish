XYZ comes from a long line of bookworms and has loved reading for as long as she can remember (thanks, mom!). She devoured YA as a teen (and has particularly fond memories of reading Harry Potter  and Pride and Prejudice). She will read almost anything, YA or not, with some combination of the following elements: an interesting female protagonist, good relationships, a post-apocalyptic setting, weird science, and/or early modern England. Her desert island book is probably The Harry Potter series but 1984 is a close second and she hopes to never have to choose, anyway.
