    <h2>REVIEW POLICY & RATING SYSTEM</h2>
    <p1>If you are an author/publisher, we strongly encourage you to familiarize yourself with the reviewers’ reviewing style and read over their preferences carefully before submitting a review request.<br>
<br>
I will accept e-books, ARCs and books from authors and publishers with a preference for hard copies. As much as I’d like to read all the books there are, by receiving your book I am not guaranteeing I will be able to read and review it, especially if it is wildly outside of my genre preferences listed below. When sending me books, please keep in mind that I will be honest when telling people what I think of them.
<br>

<h3 color = "white">Ratings System:</h3>
I am drawn towards character driven storytelling and complex plot-lines, clever wordplay or unique writing styles are a plus. While I am an emotional reader and willing to overlook weak points in favor of overall feeling, if your book is full of tropes, passive characters and/or weak world-building, you may want to consider sending it to someone else.

OMG THIS BOOK IS AMAZING. Upon finishing it, I will proceed to badger everyone I know into reading it and will not rest until I have shouted its praises to every corner of the world. Not only do I own a copy, I probably hug it sometimes.
<br>
<br>
<br>

This book was fantastic and I definitely recommend it. While it may have had some imperfections, the overall story made up for them. If I haven’t already bought a copy, I will be doing so soon.
<br>
<br>

This was a good book, I liked it but didn’t love it. My feelings could also be summed up with a non-committal shrug.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src = "two-stars.png"><br>
Meh, I finished it. It has redeeming features, I guess, but I did not connect.
<br>
<br>

Kill it with fire.
<br>
<br>
<br>

After you’ve killed it with fire, gather the ashes, bury them deep and salt the earth.
